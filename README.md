## Cari Davidson: Human-Human Interfaces

### Some things about Cari

* Gender non-binary, uses female pronouns.
* Load voice, but not as loud as many other Americans. 
* Bad hearing in her right ear, so sometimes she doesn't hear correctly.  Please be patient and understanding on this.
* Especially for a Californian, can be very direct.   She has good intentions.  If you have questions about what was said or its meaning, please ask.

### Favourite topics

* **Diversity and inclusion**:  Everyone is respected and included.  No cliques or judgment, ever.
* Working together as a family on **our** project.  I expect you to care about each other and about the work we are working on together.  You do not want to fail, and you do not want any of your brothers and sisters to fail, either.  Do not coast.  Be proactive.
* Open and psychologically safe **communication**.  Immediate feedback given.  Feedback received gracefully. Do not hold back feedback for colleagues or leads.
* **Titles have no value**.  All people can contribute to all areas.
* **Working from Home** is awesome and you should do it often.  Please put even more effort into being present on chat and email than you do in theoffice.
* Sickness sucks.  If you're sick, stay home and don't get everyone else sick.  Drink fluids, and get your strength back.  Please be honest about whether or not you're too sick to work.  If you can and want to still work, you're always welcome to stay home and work remotely, getting as much or as little time in on work as you are comfortable doing.  Just keep communication open in chats.

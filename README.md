## Cari Davidson: Human-Human Interfaces & Technical Vision

### My Role

As CTO, I am responsible for the technical vision and execution of our startup. I lead the engineering team, ensuring we build scalable, innovative solutions that align with our business goals. My primary concerns are:

* **Technical Strategy & Innovation:** Defining and driving the technology roadmap, evaluating emerging technologies, and ensuring we stay ahead of the curve.
* **Team Empowerment & Development:** Fostering a happy, productive, and growing engineering team.
* **Product Delivery & Quality:** Ensuring we deliver high-quality, reliable products that meet our customer needs.
* **Process Optimization:** Managing and evolving our engineering and team processes to maximize efficiency.

### Availability

I still value asynchronous communication and prioritize Slack for quick interactions.

* **Slack:** My preferred method for real-time communication. I still enjoy GIFs and emojis.
* **Asynchronous Tools:** For deeper discussions and documentation, I use tools like Notion and Google Docs.
* **Working Hours:** I generally work from 09:00 to 18:00, Monday to Friday, but I'm flexible and often work outside those hours.
* **Urgency:** If something is urgent, please reach out on Slack. If it's truly critical, call me.

### Meetings

I value focused and efficient meetings.

* **Scheduling:** Please use our calendar system to schedule meetings. Provide an agenda and desired outcomes.
* **Purpose:** Let's keep meetings purposeful and action-oriented.  If something could be a document, maybe it should be.
* **Ad-Hoc:** For quick discussions, reach out on Slack.  Huddles are great and feel less like a meeting.

### Management Style

My goal is to create a collaborative and empowering environment where everyone can thrive.

* **1:1s:** I believe in regular 1:1s, owned by you. If you don't have anything to discuss, we can skip it. My door is always open if something pops up, so you don't need to wait until our next 1:1 to have a discussion.
* **Team Culture:** I expect everyone to care about our work and each other. Team events are important.  Engaging with what we're doing together is important.
* **Respect & Honesty:** I expect honesty and respect toward me and toward each other. Address conflicts directly and professionally. No hate or shaming is tolerated.
* **Professionalism & Ownership:** Take ownership of your work, be a team player, and step up when needed. Use retrospectives for continuous improvement.
* **Time Management:** Manage your own time. Communicate when blocked and find alternative tasks.
* **Testing & Documentation:** Ensure thorough testing and documentation with every feature. Release when confident.
* **Avoid rabbit holes:** It's very easy to go down a rabbit hole.  Find someone to pair with before you realize you've wasted too much time.

### Some things about me

* **Non-Conformist:** I'm a non-conformist, especially regarding gender identity. My pronouns are she/her, but they/them is also fine. I'm queer and use that term liberally.
* **Direct Communication:** I'm direct and don't use excessive superlatives. "Good" means genuinely good.
* **Hearing Impairment:** I have hearing damage from my time in Iraq. Please be patient and help me understand.
* **Neurodivergence** Like most people who find computers more interesting than people, I'm a bit neuro-divergent.  Please don't read anything into my comments without asking me.
* **Dog-Friendly:** I love bringing my dog to work. If you have any concerns, please talk to me.
* **Sense of Responsibility:** I take my responsibilities seriously.
* **Off-Hours Communication:** I may send messages outside working hours. I don't expect immediate responses unless it's marked **URGENT**.

### Favourite topics

* **Diversity & Inclusion:** Everyone is respected and included. No cliques or judgment.
* **Teamwork:** We're a family working together. Care for each other and the work.
* **Open Communication:** Open and psychologically safe communication. Give and receive feedback gracefully.
* **Titles Don't Matter:** Everyone can contribute, regardless of title or experience.
* **Remote Work:** Working from home is great. Be present and communicative.
* **Sickness:** Stay home when sick. Work remotely if you can.

## Cari Davidson: Human-Human Interfaces & Technical Vision

### My Role

As CTO, I am responsible for the technical vision and execution of our startup. I lead the engineering team, ensuring we build scalable, innovative solutions that align with our business goals. My primary concerns are:

* **Technical Strategy & Innovation:** Defining and driving the technology roadmap, evaluating emerging technologies, and ensuring we stay ahead of the curve.
* **Team Empowerment & Development:** Fostering a happy, productive, and growing engineering team.
* **Product Delivery & Quality:** Ensuring we deliver high-quality, reliable products that meet our customer needs.
* **Process Optimization:** Managing and evolving our engineering and team processes to maximize efficiency.

### Availability

I still value asynchronous communication and prioritize Slack for quick interactions.

* **Slack:** My preferred method for real-time communication. I still enjoy GIFs and emojis.
* **Asynchronous Tools:** For deeper discussions and documentation, I use tools like Notion and Google Docs.
* **Working Hours:** I generally work from 09:00 to 18:00, Monday to Friday, but I'm flexible and often work outside those hours.
* **Urgency:** If something is urgent, please reach out on Slack. If it's truly critical, call me.

### Meetings

I value focused and efficient meetings.

* **Scheduling:** Please use our calendar system to schedule meetings. Provide an agenda and desired outcomes.
* **Purpose:** Let's keep meetings purposeful and action-oriented.
* **Ad-Hoc:** For quick discussions, reach out on Slack.

### Management Style

My goal is to create a collaborative and empowering environment where everyone can thrive.

* **1:1s:** I believe in regular 1:1s, owned by you. If you don't have anything to discuss, we can skip it. My door is always open.
* **Team Culture:** I expect everyone to care about our work and each other. Team events are important.
* **Respect & Honesty:** I expect honesty and respect. Address conflicts directly and professionally. No hate or shaming.
* **Professionalism & Ownership:** Take ownership of your work, be a team player, and step up when needed. Use retrospectives for continuous improvement.
* **Time Management:** Manage your own time. Communicate when blocked and find alternative tasks.
* **Testing & Documentation:** Ensure thorough testing and documentation with every feature. Release when confident.

### Some things about me

* **Non-Conformist:** I'm a non-conformist, especially regarding gender identity. My pronouns are she/her, but they/them is also fine. I'm queer and use that term liberally.
* **Direct Communication:** I'm direct and don't use excessive superlatives. "Good" means genuinely good.
* **Hearing Impairment:** I have hearing damage from my time in Iraq. Please be patient and help me understand.
* **Dog-Friendly:** I love bringing my dog to work. If you have any concerns, please talk to me.
* **Sense of Responsibility:** I take my responsibilities seriously.

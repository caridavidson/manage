## Cari Davidson: Human-Human Interfaces

### Some things about me

* I am a bit of a non-conformist, especially with respect to my gender.  I dress a bit gender-neutral most of the time, but I still use female pronouns.   It doesn't bother me if you use `they` or `them` either. 
* Like many of my fellow Americans, I have a loud voice.   Unlike most Americans - especially Californians, I am very direct and I do not speak in superlatives unless something really deserves it.   Please do not make assumptions.  If you don't undertstand something, please clarify. 
* I was in the Iraq war, and I have some hearing damage - mostly in my right ear.  If I look like I didn't hear you, maybe I didn't.  Please be patient and help me to hear and understand.  
* I have a large, fluffy sweet dog and really like bringing her to work.  If you have a problem with me bringing my dog to work, or with anything that she's doing, or how I'm managing her, please talk to me.  
* I have an over-developed sense of responsibility and will try hard not to let you down.
* I check mail frequently after work and on weekends, and sometimes send slack messages or emails off-hours.  If this happens, and you receive one of these, I don't expect you to respond or jump to action unless I use all-caps **URGENT**.  Even then, if you can't respond for whatever reason, we'll find a way out of it, but I'd appreciate your help if it comes to this.

### Favourite topics

* **Diversity and inclusion**:  Everyone is respected and included.  No cliques or judgment.  No finger-pointing or shaming.
* Working together as a family on **our** project.  I expect you to care about each other and about the work we are working on together.  You do not want to fail, and you do not want any of your brothers and sisters to fail, either.  Do not coast.  Be proactive.
* Open and psychologically safe **communication**.  Immediate feedback given.  Feedback received gracefully. Do not hold back feedback for colleagues or leads.
* **Titles have no value**.  All people can contribute to all areas regardless of title or experience.
* **Working from Home** is awesome and you should do it often.  When you do, please put even more effort into being present on chat and email than you do in theoffice.
* Sickness sucks.  If you're sick, stay home and don't get everyone else sick.  Drink fluids, and get your strength back.  Please be honest about whether or not you're too sick to work.  If you can and want to still work, you're always welcome to stay home and work remotely, getting as much or as little time in on work as you are comfortable doing.  Just keep communication open in chats.

### Expectations as a Manager

* I expect people to be honest and respectful to each other.  We are all here to do the best we can.  Please be understanding of that and respect and be kind to each other. There is no room for hate on my team.  If you do have personal issues with other teammates, or with me, I epect you to be an adult and work that out with each other and learn how to work together.
* I expect you to be professional and do the best work that you can do, while being a humble team player. No shaming or finger-pointing please, and step up sometimes when you feel something needs to be done. 
* I expect you to manage your own time. You're a well-paid engineer.  If you're blocked by something, communicate with your teammates and get unblocked.  If something is blocked and you cannot proceed, find something else to work on.  if nothing is obvious to work on, talk to me, the product owner, or your teammates and see if anyone could use a hand on what they're working on.  There are almost always code reviews and documentation that need doing.
* Testing and Documentation.  Sometimes we are working in go-mode and we take some shortcuts and don't have great testing or documentation.  This happens, but is not ideal.  I expect you to always update documentation and testing with every feature developed.  Are your tests sufficient for you to feel confident to release code?  Good! Then release code!  If not, write more tests!
